# Reverse Snake

A twist on the classic Snake game built with Javascript and HTML Canvas. Instead of growing the snake, the goal is to survive as long as possible without being caught!

The primary goal was to build a robust and efficient game loop and implement precise collision detection algorithms. 

I prioritized core game mechanics over graphical assets to highlight the underlying logic and performance.
